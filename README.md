# Portfolio Repository
Hello! I am Isaac Kerson. I'm a life long educator with masters degrees in Education and Data Analytics. I have held the positions of Learning Analyst at Gachon University and Lead Analytics  Engineer for Stibo Systems. I currently do Learning Analytics work at Georgia Institute of Technology. My areas of interest are educational analytics, educational data mining, and machine learning algorithms for educational tools.

Welcome to my portfolio repository. It contains samples of my data analytics and machine learning work. Visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaackerson/) to see my resume and connect.

## Housing Analysis
The [`housing_analysis`](https://github.com/ikerson/portfolio/tree/main/housing_analysis) folder contains a Jupyter notebook with analysis of Boston housing data using various Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, scipy, and statsmodels.

## Predict Crew Size
Objective: Build a regressor that recommends the crew size for ship buyers. I use XGBoost to build a distributed random regression model for predicting cruise ship crew size. Tools: XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy

## International Education
The international_ed folder includes a notebook using PISA standardized score data to build a PCA model in sci-kit learn to compare international education scores.

Feel free to explore the contents of each folder and the code within the notebooks. If you have any questions or feedback, please contact me.
