The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an internationally standardised assessment that was jointly developed by participating countries and administered to 15-year-olds in schools. Tests are typically administered to between 4 500 and 10 000 students in each country. PISA assesses how far students near the end of compulsory education have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in society. In all cycles, the domains of reading, mathematical and scientific literacy are covered not merely in terms of mastery of the school curriculum, but in terms of important knowledge and skills needed in adult life.

5,EDUPUBEXP,public spending on education,float,20675.54,"Public spending on education includes direct expenditure on educational institutions as well as educational-related public subsidies given to households and administered by educational institutions. This indicator is shown as a percentage of GDP, divided by primary, primary to post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary levels. Public entities include ministries other than ministries of education, local and regional governments, and other public agencies. Public spending includes expenditure on schools, universities and other public and private institutions delivering or supporting educational services. This indicator shows the priority given by governments to education relative to other areas of investment, such as health care, social security, defence and security. Education expenditure covers expenditure on schools, universities and other public and private institutions delivering or supporting educational services.

6,STUDPERTEACHER,students per teacher,float,14.926,"The ratio of students per teaching staff is the total number of full-time equivalent students enrolled at a specific level of education divided by the total number of full-time equivalent teachers at the same level. Teachers refer to professional personnel directly involved in teaching students: classroom teachers, special education teachers and other teachers who work with students as a whole class in a classroom, in small groups in a resource room, or in one-to-one teaching inside or outside a regular classroom. This does not include teachersâ€™ aides and other paraprofessional personnel.

78,TEACHINGHR,teaching hours,float,658.2,"This indicator presents preparation time and statutory teaching time. Teaching time is the number of hours spent teaching a group or class of students according to the formal policy in the country; preparation time is the time spent preparing for teaching. For pre-primary, primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools, teaching time is presented in hours per year. For lower secondary schools, both teaching time and preparation time are shown in hours per week.

9,GDP,gross domestic product,float,600269.926,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports). While GDP is the single most important indicator to capture economic activity, it falls short of providing a suitable measure of people's material well-being for which alternative indicators may be more appropriate. This indicator is based on nominal GDP (also called GDP at current prices or GDP in value) and is available in different measures: US dollars and US dollars per capita (current PPPs). All OECD countries compile their data according to the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). This indicator is less suited for comparisons over time, as developments are not only caused by real growth, but also by changes in prices and PPPs.

10,TAXREV,tax revenue,float,84.845,"Tax revenue is defined as the revenues collected from taxes on income and profits, social security contributions, taxes levied on goods and services, payroll taxes, taxes on the ownership and transfer of property, and other taxes. Total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP indicates the share of a country's output that is collected by the government through taxes. It can be regarded as one measure of the degree to which the government controls the economy's resources. The tax burden is measured by taking the total tax revenues received as a percentage of GDP. This indicator relates to government as a whole (all government levels) and is measured in million USD and percentage of GDP.

12,EDUPRIVATEEXP,private spending on education,float,19356.25,"Private spending on education refers to expenditure funded by private sources which are households and other private entities. This indicator is shown as a percentage of GDP, divided into primary, primary to post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary levels. Private spending on education includes all direct expenditure on educational institutions, net of public subsidies, also excluding expenditure outside educational institutions such as textbooks purchased by families, private tutoring for students and student living costs. Private spending includes expenditure on schools, universities and other public and private institutions delivering or supporting educational services.
